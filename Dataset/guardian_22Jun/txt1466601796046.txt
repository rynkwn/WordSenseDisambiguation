The recipe

Put 650g of assorted small tomatoes (red, orange, yellow, green, cherry etc) 
into a roasting tin with a crushed clove of garlic and 2 tbsp olive oil. Peel 
and slice a red onion and add it to the tomatoes with a seasoning of salt and 
black pepper. Roast at 200C/gas mark 6 for 25-30 minutes until the tomatoes are 
soft and the skins lightly browned.

Bring 400ml of vegetable stock to the boil. Place 100g of instant couscous 
into a heat-proof bowl, then pour the boiling stock over, cover and leave for 
15 minutes. Roughly chop 15g each of mint and parsley.

Use a fork to lightly crush the tomatoes so the juices bleed into the pan, 
then stir in 1 tbsp of harissa paste. Stir most of the chopped herbs through 
the couscous with a fork. Serve the roast tomatoes and their juices on top of 
the couscous. A few herbs can be added on top. Serves 2.

The trick

It is perfectly fine to use water to plump up your couscous, but I like using 
stock, in this case vegetable, to add flavour to the bland grain. Use liquid 
just off the boil, and pour enough over the couscous to cover it by a good 3 or 
4cm. Covering the bowl with a plate or lid will help it to keep its heat during 
the 10 minutes or so it takes for the grains to sponge up the liquid. No 
further heating required.

The twist

If time is tight, you could grill the tomatoes and onions, setting the 
roasting tin a good way from the heat and turning the vegetables from time to 
time as they cook. This also makes a cracking summer salad. Cook as above, but 
let the couscous and the tomatoes cool a little before serving. Instead of 
finishing with mint and parsley, make a herb mixture of chopped basil and 
finely grated lemon zest, then toss with toasted, finely crumbed ciabatta and a 
glug of olive oil.
