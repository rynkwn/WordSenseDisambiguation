Scientists have discovered differences in the brain structure 
<http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_26-9-2013-17-43-4>
 of ballet dancers that may help them avoid feeling dizzy. The research 
suggests that years of training can enable dancers to suppress signals from the 
balance organs in the inner ear. Barry Seemungal, from the department of 
medicine at Imperial, says: "It's not useful for a ballet dancer to feel dizzy 
or off balance. Their brains adapt over years of training to suppress that 
input. Consequently, the signal going to the brain areas responsible for 
perception of dizziness in the cerebral cortex is reduced, making dancers 
resistant to feeling dizzy." He adds: "If we can target that same brain area or 
monitor it in patients with chronic dizziness, we can begin to understand how 
to treat them better."

A study shows there's been a dramatic fall in death rates after hip 
replacements <http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2013/9771.html>. Findings show that 
mortality rates in the first 90 days following hip replacement surgery has 
halved. The study also found that overweight patients have a lower risk of 
death than those with a "normal" body mass index. Ashley Blom, professor of 
orthopaedic surgery at the University of Bristol, says: "It is very exciting 
that we can further reduce the risk of post-operative death by adopting four 
relatively simple measures." He adds: "The finding that overweight people have 
a lower risk of death is surprising, but has been confirmed by other recent 
studies, and challenges some of our preconceptions. We need to concentrate 
efforts on reducing the risk of death in high risk groups such as those with 
severe liver disease."

An investigation into how musicians find creative inspiration  
<http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/music-in-the-making-0>has identified four 
key ingredients needed for creative expression. These are: freedom, 
flexibility, a sense of being "in the moment", and a commitment to "giving" the 
music to an audience. The study found that breakthrough moments of inspiration 
often took place while musicians were humming pieces to themselves, imagining 
dance moves or emotional narratives inspired by the music, or tapping out 
rhythms on nearby furniture, rather than using their instruments. John Rink, 
professor of musical performance studies at the University of Cambridge, says: 
"By discovering for themselves key aspects of the creative process, the 
performers in our study have been able to reflect on what it is that makes them 
individually creative and to unlock more of that for themselves." He adds: 
"Some of our discoveries thus far may feed into a performance curriculum 
allowing students to aspire to - and attain - greater musical inspiration and 
creative individuality than they already achieve."

A fragile 165-year-old pamphlet – the only surviving copy of a Chartist hymn 
book – has been transformed into a CD by a veteran protest singer. Called
Liberty is Near! <http://www.garthhewitt.org/>, it is the first time Chartist 
hymns have been recorded. The hymn books were designed in an attempt to produce 
a standard hymn book for the movement. Garth Hewitt, who made the recordings, 
says: "I think [the hymns] are interesting politically and I think they are 
also interesting for the church community to see the way that social justice 
and a theology come together in these songs with great power." He adds: "As I 
recorded these songs from 1845 they came alive to me and I kept seeing a 
remarkable relevance to our own society."

Research reveals that large numbers of Christian university students are 
affirming their faith in private 
<https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=18600> and not attending Sunday 
service. The study, which looked at undergraduates from 13 different English 
universities, found that liberal Christians outnumbered evangelical Christians 
tenfold on campus. It shows that many students start to detach themselves from 
church by the time they reach this formative stage in life. Lead author Mathew 
Guest, at Durham University, says: "With the vast majority of Christian 
students affirming a moderate expression of values in keeping with wider 
British culture, the Church faces a difficult decision about whether to adapt 
to changing times or risk permanently alienating an entire generation." He 
adds: "As educated, upwardly mobile individuals, the Church risks alienating an 
important demographic group – the future leaders of society who could be major 
standard bearers for Christian tradition. The challenge for the Church will be 
finding a way of engaging the interests and enthusiasms of this generation."

Racial, ethnic and sexual inequality in the US has deepened 
<http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3433/why_americas_finance_industry_is_good_for_white_male_bankers_but_bad_for_everyone_else>
 as a result of the dominance of financial services, a study shows. Researchers 
compared the earnings of white, Hispanic and Black men and women working in 
different jobs between 1983 and 2009. They found the earnings of white men 
working in managerial and financial services rose more rapidly than that of 
Hispanic and Black men and women employed in all sectors of the US economy 
during the 26-year period. Research also showed that white males working in 
managerial and financial services earned more than white males working in any 
part of the economy. The study is the first comprehensive analysis of how the 
dominance of the financial services sector has affected different demographic 
groups in the U.S. "The results were startling," says Giuseppe Fontana, 
professor of monetary economics at Leeds University. "The wage premium of white 
men working in finance has risen considerably over the last three decades at 
the expense of women and ethnic groups. This suggests that financialisation has 
actually stratified society, and widened the gulf between white men at the top 
and women and ethnic minorities."

A long-lost portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte thought to be worth around £2m has 
beendiscovered in New York by a University of Reading researcher 
<http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR537024.aspx>. The painting 
by renowned 18/19th century French artist Jacques-Louis David captures Napoleon 
pledging to defend France in 1813 in its hour of need, as the British and 
Prussians threatened to invade and occupy France. Simon Lee, from the 
University of Reading's art department, says: "I am thrilled to have discovered 
this beautiful painting which offers a unique insight into the role that art 
could play at a time of war. By having his portrait painted in National Guard 
uniform, Napoleon was promoting himself as protector and defender of the nation 
at the time when France was under great threat." He adds: "David produced an 
image of the Emperor to galvanise resistance and foster patriotism, yet the 
painting never reached a wide audience because of the unexpectedly swift allied 
invasion that ensured the image remained uncirculated and practically unknown."
