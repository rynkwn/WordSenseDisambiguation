Italians – or, rather, Venetians, Tuscans, Sicilians and so on – have very 
specific baking styles.

From one region to the next – actually, from one village to the next – recipes 
and traditions differ greatly. They take pride in these nuances. With pride 
comes tradition, and with tradition comes history.

When Italians settled in the US, there was no shortage of this pride, as seen 
in the Italian rainbow cookie, combining the flavours of Italy with the bold 
aesthetic of America. I recently had to find a way to bake some, even though 
the brief left me cold. Food colouring? Almond extract? Apricot jam with 
chocolate? But somehow all of these ingredients come together to form a 
delicious treat with a very moreish texture. I liked them so much that we have 
started making them at the bakery, defying all my no-food-colouring rules.

More in keeping with my seasonal approach to baking is panna cotta. This 
milk-and-cream-based pudding is the perfect canvas for fresh, roasted or 
poached fruit. I chose nespole (or loquat) because, when roasted lightly, they 
melt beautifully into the pudding. Texture is key here. Made without eggs, 
panna cotta is set with gelatin for a light and refreshing dessert. As it sits, 
the gelatin continues to set, so this is at its best made on the same day you 
plan to serve it.

Panna cotta with roasted nespole

Serves 6
2 tsp powdered gelatin
2 tbsp cold water
240g double cream
240g milk
75g caster sugar
1 vanilla pod, scraped
Zest of one lemon
A pinch fine salt
300g Greek yoghurt 

For the fruit
12 nespole (loquats)
1 vanilla pod
4 tbsp caster sugar
Juice of one lemon
100g Amaretto

1 To make the panna, I recommend starting the morning of the evening you 
intend to serve it. You could make it the night before but it sets a little too 
firmly for my taste.

2 Have ready a large bowl with a sieve suspended above it. Bloom the gelatin 
in the 2 tbsp water and set aside.

3 In a heavy saucepan, heat the cream and milk gently with the sugar, scraped 
vanilla pod, lemon zest and salt. Heat until frothy (not quite boiling), remove 
from the heat and sieve into the prepared bowl.

4 Whisk a little of the cream with the bloomed gelatin, then whisk the gelatin 
into the remaining cream mixture. Whisk in the yoghurt.

5 Pour the mixture into a large serving bowl and chill.

6 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a roasting dish with baking 
parchment. Cut the nespole in half and take out the stones along with the tough 
skin that surrounds them. Place the fruits cut-side up in the dish.

7 Put the vanilla seeds and pod on top of the nespole. Sprinkle with the sugar 
and lemon juice. Lastly, pour over the Amaretto and place the tray in the oven 
to bake for 15-20 minutes or until the fruit is starting to caramelise on the 
edges.

8 Remove the fruit from the oven and allow to cool slightly.

9 To serve, scoop a generous portion of panna cotta on to a plate, and spoon 
the fruit alongside it.

Italian rainbow cookies

These soft “cookies” are more like a multi-layered traybake, but they keep 
really well.

Makes 28

400g unsalted butter, at room temperature
300g almond paste (50%), chopped (not marzipan, see tip)
270g caster sugar
1 tbsp almond extract
6 large eggs, separated
385g plain flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp red food colouring
½ tsp green food colouring (leaf green)
245g apricot jam, heated, strained
100g dark chocolate (70%), chopped
80g double cream

1 Heat the oven to 170C/340F/gas mark 3½. Butter and line three 20cm x 30cm x 
2cm (or deeper) metal baking trays with baking paper (one for each coloured 
layer of sponge). If you don’t have three tins, you can simply bake the cakes 
in three batches.

2 In the bowl of a stand mixer, weigh the butter, 200g of caster sugar, almond 
paste and almond extract. Beat until pale and fluffy, then beat in the egg 
yolks one at a time, add the flour and salt, then scrape into another bowl and 
wash your mixing bowl very well.

3 Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk 
attachment; whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually add 70g sugar, whisking 
until stiff.

4 Incorporate half of the egg whites into the almond paste mixture to loosen 
the batter, before folding in the second half of the egg whites.

5 Divide the batter evenly between three bowls. Mix the red colouring into one 
bowl, the green into a second bowl, and leave the third bowl plain.

6 Spread one bowl of batter into each prepared tin and smooth the tops. Bake 
for 20 minutes or until set. Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the pans, before 
removing to a cooling rack.

7 Once cooled, start with the green cake as a base. Spread half the apricot 
jam to the edges of the cake. Place the plain cake layer on top of the green, 
brush with the remaining apricot jam, and top with the red layer. Cover the 
cake with baking paper. Place one of the baking tins on top, weighing it down 
with something heavy, such as tins of tomatoes. Leave for at least two hours, 
or overnight, to compress.

8 To ice, place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl, then heat the 
cream until it just starts to bubble, and pour over the chocolate pieces. Let 
it sit for 5 minutes, then stir together until smooth.

9 Spread the ganache over the cake and leave it to set for 10 minutes before 
slicing. These cookies will keep for a week in an airtight container.
