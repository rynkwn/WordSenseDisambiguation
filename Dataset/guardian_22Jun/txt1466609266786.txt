Mason's Southern Provisions and Mason Bar


One of the newest restaurants on the Nashville dining scene is inside the 
recently renovatedLoews Vanderbilt Hotel 
<http://www.loewshotels.com/Vanderbilt-Hotel>. The innovative Southern cuisine 
coming from this kitchen is a far cry from what many expect from hotel food. 
The Devil of an Egg appetiser (devilled eggs topped with bacon jam and 
mustard-seed caviar) and the Crab Corn Dogs with Mississippi comeback sauce (a 
particularly tasty blend of ketchup, mustard and mayo) are just a couple of the 
playful offerings on the menu. Remember to save room for dessert and end your 
evening with a liquid nitrogen ice-cream soda featuring two popular locally 
made products, Whisper Creek Tennessee Sipping Cream and Goo Goo Clusters. 
Delicious and cool in more ways than one, this top-secret menu item can only be 
ordered at a moment's tweet to @MasonsNashville.

Arnold's Country Kitchen

 Arnold's 
The bright red-and-yellow cinder block building that houses Arnold's Country 
Kitchen usually has a line out the door shortly after 11am every weekday. Only 
open for lunch Monday to Friday, the tables are filled with a mix of 
politicians, musicians, construction workers and local fashionistas, all 
happily eating elbow to elbow. The cafeteria-style buffet is full of homemade 
classics made daily like catfish, chicken and dumplings, fried green tomatoes, 
mashed potatoes, and banana pudding. Even a few of the classics are served with 
a twist – greens seasoned with wasabi powder, creamy cheese grits spiced with 
flecks of jalapeno, and chocolate pie with a hint of cayenne pepper.

Hattie B's Hot Chicken

 Hattie B's Hot Chicken 
As they say, some like it hot. The faint of heart might just like it medium; 
braver souls will go for Damn Hot. Nashville hot chicken is a local speciality 
that every visitor must try once. Hattie B's, a charming little eatery decked 
out with chicken wire, corrugated metal and white-washed picnic tables, is a 
great place to start. Step up to the counter, choose your chicken (white or 
dark), level of heat, and your two sides. If you do this correctly, your lips 
will be tingling, your nose running, and your tongue on fire. You may even 
break into a sweat. Hopefully there won't be any tears but, just in case, make 
sure you've chosen wisely with your sides. Some refreshing black-eyed pea salad 
and creamy pimento macaroni cheese should ease the burn.
• 112 19th Avenue South, +1 615 678 4794, hattieb.com <http://www.hattieb.com/>
. Open Mon-Thurs 11am-10pm, Fri-Sat 11am-midnight, Sun 11am-4pm. Mains from $8

Lockeland Table Community Kitchen and Bar

 Lockeland Table Community Kitchen 
The cosy confines of Lockeland Table, combined with the offering of high-end 
comfort food, can make one feel like they're dining at the home of a good 
friend. With a country-inspired menu, the food is rustic, yet refined. Served 
alongside grilled Tuscan bread, chicken liver pate made with Benton's bacon fat 
and a mound of peach preserves ($9) is a decadent start to the meal. Sweet 
potato gnocchi with smoked corn cream, blistered tomato, spinach, apples, 
pecans and KY bleu gouda is about as delicious and comforting as it can get. No 
matter what the size of your party, reservations are highly recommended.

Fido

 Fido, Nashville 
Upon entry to Fido, you're immediately hit by the delicious aroma of locally 
roasted Bongo Java coffee, a boisterous ambience, and the feeling that you've 
just stumbled on something truly special. While coffee is the heart of the 
operation, the food is the soul. Fido's eclectic crowd can enjoy a menu of 
thoughtfully prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner dishes, composed of local 
ingredients. The food, described by the chef as Mediterranean and Latin, is 
"underpinned by a strong Southern backbone". The specials chalkboard above the 
front counter is definitely the place to find some of that Southern backbone 
shining through, like Pulled Pork Tacos made up of local pork shoulder, 
zucchini & pickled onion pico, guajillo sauce, crispy okra, goat and sheep's 
milk feta, mango hot sauce, basil, and flour tortillas ($12).
• 1812 21st Avenue South, +1 615 777-FIDO (3436), bongojava.com/fido

City House

 City House 
Under a canopy of trees, tucked away in the historic Germantown district, City 
House beckons. With its brick facade, rustic screened-in porch, open kitchen 
and wood-burning oven, you instantly feel at home in the inviting space. City 
House's menu is brimming with Italian-meets-Southern dishes like fettuccine 
with pork, greens and beans, cornmeal-crusted catfish with cauliflower and hot 
sauce or belly ham pizza ($15). Insider tip: ask your server to put an egg on 
top of that pizza for an extra $2. If you're fortunate enough to be in town on 
a Sunday night, then you won't want to miss the special Sunday Supper – just 
make a reservation in advance.

The Patterson House

 The Patterson House 
In a discreetly marked building near Music Row, locals and in-the-know 
visitors sip handcrafted cocktails under vintage chandeliers. Only a stone's 
throw yet worlds away from the honkytonks of Lower Broadway, The Patterson 
House feels like a private, very secret, club. Yet it's not. There's no 
handshake, no password, no list you must be on. There are, however, some posted 
rules one must follow like: "No fighting, no play fighting, no talking about 
fighting, no star f*cking, no name-dropping…"; and a dress code: "Preserve the 
sexy." Once you make it past the velvet curtain, order a Bacon Old Fashioned – 
Benton's bacon-infused Four Roses Bourbon, maple syrup and pecan coffee 
bitters, some pork rinds and the Elvis panini. A playful tribute to the King of 
rock'n'roll, the sandwich is a decadent combination of peanut butter, bananas 
and bacon.
• 1711 Division Street, +1 615 636 7724, thepattersonnashville.com 
<http://thepattersonnashville.com/>. Open daily, 5pm-3am. Mixed drinks from 
$11, Elvis panini $7

Flyte World Dining and Wine

 Flyte World Dining and Wine 
Sustainably sourced, local ingredients shine in the whimsical, inventive 
dishes coming out of the kitchen at Flyte World Dining and Wine. The lounge has 
been known to serve one of the most surprisingly elegant comfort food dishes in 
the city: a humble, yet decadent, rabbit pot pie. In the main dining room, 
patrons exalt over the chef's creative reinterpretation of traditional Southern 
chicken and waffles, a two-day yeast waffle topped with thinly sliced spicy pig 
ears, a silky buttermilk custard, bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup and spritz of 
house-made hot sauce.
• 718 Division Street, +1 615 255 6200, flytenashville.com 
<http://www.flytenashville.com/>. Dining Room open Tues-Thurs 5pm-9pm, Fri-Sat 
5pm-10pm. Mains from $24, small plates from $8

Edley's Bar-B-Que

 Edley's BBQ, Nashville 
For passersby, the smoky aroma wafting from this casual BBQ eatery in the 12 
South neighbourhood makes it nearly impossible to resist. Step inside the door 
and you'll be greeted by the sweet sound of blues or bluegrass music, which 
should help entertain you as you begin the difficult decision-making process of 
what to order from the menu board. Locals know that the fried pickles are the 
best in town, and the Tuck Special is a thing of wonder. Brisket piled high on 
a fluffy bun, layered with house-made pimento cheese, an over-easy egg, 
pickles, and both red and white sauce, is certainly one of the most interesting 
BBQ sandwiches around. As your food is being prepared, belly up to the barnwood 
bar or soak up the sun on the expansive deck, while sipping some bourbon fruit 
tea from a Mason jar.
• 2706 12th Avenue South, +1 615 953 2951, edleysbbq.com 
<http://edleysbbq.com/>. Open 11am-10pm, bar open later. Mains from $9

Etch

 Etch, Nashville 
To many, cowboy hats and country music come to mind when envisioning Nashville 
but, in recent years, the city has transformed into a decidedly more 
cosmopolitan, sophisticated place. On the ground floor of one of downtown's 
condominium towers, Etch, with its open kitchen and sleek dining room, is a 
reflection of the changing times. Bold, intense flavour combinations turn 
standard ingredients into mind-boggling creations that delight and tickle the 
palate. For lunch, the Pork Pork Pork Sammie is a decadent combination of 
house-cured ham, Tennessee prosciutto, roasted pork loin, brie, pickled apple, 
ginger mustard, and sweet potato jam on sourdough bread. If you're visiting in 
the evening, try the incredible Moroccan-spiced venison with ginger grits, pear 
butter and cranberry sumac relish from the dinner menu.
• 303 Demonbreun Street, +1 615 522 0685, etchrestaurant.com 
<http://etchrestaurant.com/>. Open Mon-Thurs 11am-2pm and 5pm-10pm; Fri
