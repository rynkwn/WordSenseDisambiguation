St Julien Hotel and Spa

The only new hotel to be built downtown in the past 100 years, the upmarket St 
Julien, which opened in 2005, has views of the Flatirons, a top-notch spa, and 
a prime location one block off Pearl Street. The accent is on low waste, with 
yoga and free rental bikes an added touch. It's something of a local hangout, 
too, because there's live music five nights a week, the lobby and gardens have 
free Wi-Fi, and it puts on a stellar Sunday brunch.

Boulder Outlook
 Boulder Outlook Hotel 
Boulder's reputation as a greenies' mecca is well-founded, and if you're in 
town for that kind of thing, the 162-room Outlook, on the south-west side of 
town, is the place to stay. It's the first zero-waste hotel in Boulder, and the 
Blues and Greens restaurant focuses on local food. It was built as a Holiday 
Inn in the 1960s, so it bears the bones of a chain hotel, but on the inside 
it's been re-engineered, and is spacious and full of light. It's dog friendly, 
and has an indoor climbing wall – another very Boulder touch.

Boulder Mountain Lodge
 Boulder Mountain Lodge, Boulder 
The Boulder Mountain Lodge is five minutes west of town, just up Boulder 
Canyon, but that five minutes makes a big difference: it feels like you're in 
the mountains. There's hiking, fishing and biking right outside the door, and 
as it's on the Boulder Creek Path it's an easy walk or bike to town. Originally 
built as a bunkhouse for University of Colorado students, the lodge has 
expanded and now has 30 units, from single rooms with kitchenettes to a cabin 
that can fit a whole family. Amenities include rental bikes and a creek-side 
pool and hot tub.

Silver Saddle Motel
 Silver Saddle Motel, Boulder 
Sandwiched between the Flatirons and Eben G Fine Park 
<http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&id=9610&Itemid=3170>
 – a summer tubing and picnicking hotspot – and with quick access to the 
mountains; downtown is a short walk too. The 32 simple rooms and cabins are 
pared down, but all have TV and internet, and most have a kitchenette option.

Chautauqua
 The Colorado Chautauqua park, Boulder 
The Colorado Chautauqua park is a must on any trip to Boulder. Founded in 1898 
as a cultural retreat, it drew people from all over the country to stay in the 
park and listen to summertime lectures. The 58 original cottages range from 
small studios to spacious three beds. They all have kitchens, Wi-Fi and big 
porches, but no TVs – solitude is the goal here. There is good hiking, and 
concerts and events almost every night.

Alps Boulder Canyon Inn
 Alps Boulder Canyon Inn, Boulder 
This 12-room inn was built before 1870, before Colorado was even a state, and 
figures high on the cosy scale (and a long way from one of its previous 
incarnations, as a bordello). Tucked up in Boulder Canyon, at the confluence of 
Boulder and Four Mile creeks, its rooms have fireplaces and mountainside patios 
or porches. Breakfast comes highly rated, as do the complimentary afternoon 
cookies. You're an easy jaunt from downtown, and from hiking in the canyon.

Briar Rose Boulder
 Briar Rose, Boulder 
Tucked into a centrally located Queen Anne-style house just south of Pearl 
Street, the 10-room Briar Rose is run by a Zen monk and his wife. There's 
unlimited tea and cookies, a garden and meditation room, and the light-filled 
rooms are individually decorated – each reflects the Japanese sensibilities of 
the innkeepers. The Briar Rose is a zero-waste house … the owners even do the 
organic breakfast shopping by bike.

The Bradley Boulder
 Bradley Boulder Inn, Boulder 
The most modern of the Boulder B&Bs, and purpose built – so every room has its 
own bathroom. However, it blends in with the older local architecture. It's two 
blocks north of Pearl Street, an easy walk from downtown, and guests have 
access to a local health club. The rooms all have Wi-Fi, TVs and fireplaces. 
The nightly wine and cheese happy hour is a highlight, as is the local art on 
the walls.

Lookout Inn
 The Lookout Inn, Boulder 
This family-run inn is located on the north-east side of Boulder, close to the 
Boulder reservoir and up-and-coming North Boulder. All 13 rooms are named after 
Colorado destinations and they all have patios and fireplaces. Breakfast is 
included, and the inn is affiliated with the nearby Ayurvedic LifeSpa, a 
10-minute walk away, which offers detoxifying Panchakarma massage.

The Boulderado
 Boulderado Hotel, Boulder 
A Boulder institution, in operation since New Year's Day 1909. The original 
cherrywood staircase and the lobby's tiled floor have lived through Boulder's 
mining and railroad days. It's on the national register of historic places, is 
still owned by Boulder locals, and, rumour has it, has several generations of 
ghosts. The 160 rooms reflect the hotel's Edwardian roots, but they've been 
updated – right down to the iPod docks. Large groups can stay at the nearbyPine 
Street Guest House <http://boulderado.com/rooms/pine-street-guest-house/>. The 
dark and cavernous Catacombs bar, in the basement, is worth a visit.
