Countries are finding that the urban economic development to which they aspire 
brings poisoned air, ill-health, massive costs, a low quality of life and, 
probably, an early death for a very great many people.

That is the stark conclusion from a reading of the new database of outdoor air 
quality <http://www.who.int/phe/en/> from the World Health Organisation (WHO), 
for 3,000 of the world’s cities. While millions of people in rich countries 
suffer the cancers, heart and respiratory diseases that air pollution brings, 
the levels of air pollution in many Asian and African cities are said to be 
five or even 10 times worse.

The WHO data shows that there is now little or no escape from the plague of 
poisoned air 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/air-pollution-rising-at-an-alarming-rate-in-worlds-cities>
; people in 98% of cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 
100,000 inhabitants are breathing air with pollution levels that exceed WHO 
minimum safety guidelines. That figure is almost halved in high-income 
countries, where the figure is 56%.

And the problem is rapidly worsening as most Asian and African cities burgeon 
without planning controls, as car numbers multiply and as industry and 
transport are allowed to pollute the air more or less unhindered. The WHO, 
which estimates more than 3 million people die prematurely from outdoor air 
pollution each year, suggests that it is 8% to 10% worse globally than five 
years ago.


But it admits it is impossible to know exactly. Pollution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pollution> monitoring in most 
low-income cities is, at best, sparse and in most countries, unreliable or 
non-existent. Of the 3,000 cities in the WHO database, only 12 are from Africa.


But anyone who lives in Lagos, Tehran, Kabul 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/which-are-the-worlds-two-most-polluted-cities-and-why>
 or 1,000 other cities in poor countries knows well, the traffic is getting 
worse every year and the air is increasingly unbreathable. In the past, rich 
people in industrialised countries in Europe and the US would pay more to live 
upwind of industrial pollution, to escape the foul air. Today the rich and 
middle classes of Saudi Arabia, India and China leave town during the worst 
pollution episodes, or even relocate.


People in cities complain bitterly today but the full health tragedy will not 
be seen for many years. Because the effects of air pollution are chronic, or 
slow, they build up in the body and impact mostly on older people.Children 
exposed to heavy traffic fumes today will have smaller lungs 
<http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et1100/et1100s14.html> and be more vulnerable to 
respiratory and heart diseases in their later years.


By not addressing air pollution now, governments, NGOs and individuals are 
storing up a health timebomb for the future, guaranteeing that hospital wards 
will be full of wheezing people with hearts and lungs permanently damaged just 
by living near busy roads or factories. The vast costs to the economy of caring 
for an increasingly infirm older population will have to be met later.


But the report brings hope. The air quality in more than 700 of the cities in 
the database can be compared over 10 years and here the WHO sees many cities 
are reducing air pollution. By checking traffic growth, reducing industrial 
smokestack emissions, increasing the use of renewable power sources, and 
prioritising walking and cycling networks, they are rapidly – and cheaply – 
improving air quality and cutting the number of deaths. According to the UN, 
more than half of the 3,000 monitored cities in high-income countries and 
around one in three of those in low- and middle-income countries have lowered 
their air pollution levels by more than 5% in the past five years.


Most governments and individuals still do not see air pollution as a major 
issue, but as one of the inevitable prices of economic development. They may 
easily understand that people die of malaria, obesity, alcohol or malnutrition, 
but may not appreciate the grave risks of air pollution.


Yet it’s the biggest killer in the world and likely to put the biggest brake 
on development in the future.
