Little Molas Lake Campground, San Juan national forest

People flock to Little Molas ostensibly for its proximity to Andrews Lake, a 
high-altitude tarn stocked with rainbow and brook trout. But the setting itself 
– at over 3,300m, encircled by the often snowy, incisor-like peaks of Snowdon, 
Grand Turk, Engineer and Twin Sisters – is reason enough to visit. The campsite 
balances in the high trough between the towns of Durango and Silverton, with 
excellent hiking access to the Colorado Trail. There's good rock climbing and a 
beautiful waterfall six miles down the south side of Molas Pass, in Cascade 
Canyon. Though summer can be glorious, sudden rain, hail and snow is common – 
even in summer – so come prepared with a solid tent and plenty of foul-weather 
gear.

Angel of Shavano, San Isabel national forest
 Photograph: Alamy 
Wedged between two steep ridges in the upper Arkansas Valley, Angel of Shavano 
is surprisingly remote and little known, given its close proximity to the town 
of Salida. The Colorado Trail (the 486-mile single track that traverses the 
state) passes through camp, making for excellent, if chest-constricting biking 
– the campsite is situated 2,800m above sea level. The even more intrepid can 
hike the trails to the 4,300m summits of Mount Shavano and Mount Tabeguache. 
There's fishing in the North Fork reservoir, just up the valley, but you'll 
need a jeep or 4x4 to navigate the rough mountain road.

Oh Be Joyful Campground, Crested Butte
 Photograph: Alamy 
At the end of a hanging valley, Crested Butte is the quintessential Colorado 
mountain town, with verdant alpine meadows stretching impossibly upward to 
serrated peaks all around. Oh Be Joyful crouches in the trees along a lost dirt 
road north of town, with dispersed tent sites and little else in the way of 
infrastructure. A trail leads west from the campground into the Raggeds 
Wilderness, past pyramid-shaped Garfield Peak, and eventually to the 3,650m Oh 
Be Joyful Pass. There's fishing north along the Slate river, icy mountain pools 
for a dip on hot summer days, and, if the water is high, excellent kayaking.

Pinyon Flats Campground, Great Sand Dunes national park
 Photograph: Alamy 
The San Luis Valley, a massive, grassy high basin to the east of the San Juan 
Mountains in south central Colorado, is one of the most majestic places in the 
entire state. At the southeast end of the valley is Great Sand Dunes National 
Park, home to the largest dunes in the US, though the 230m crests look 
diminutive beneath the jagged 4,300m peaks above. Pinyon Flats is the place to 
stay, with abundant hiking throughout the dunes. If you're lucky, some 
enterprising local will have sand skis or a snowboard they'll lend you to whisk 
down the steeps. And in May, Medano Creek overflows with melt water and creates 
a water park for all the family.

Saddlehorn Campground, Colorado national monument
 Photograph: Alamy 
Saddlehorn is the only established campsite in the Monument, and its 80 
established sites fill quickly in summer. It's situated at the west end of the 
23-mile long scenic drive, which winds through steep red-rock canyons, beneath 
crumbling sandstone towers, and up on to the piñon and juniper-pocked mesa for 
expansive views back down to Grand Junction and the valley. Thesix-mile hike 
along the Monument Canyon Trail 
<http://www.hikespeak.com/trails/independence-monument-canyon-colorado-national-monument/>
 is arguably the park's finest, with access to the signature rock formations, 
but there are hundreds of miles of back-country desert hiking for the 
adventurous. The loop road makes a scenic road-bike ride, and there's rock 
climbing in the park.

Bassam Guardstation and Cabin, Buena Vista
 Bassam Guard Station, Buena Vista, Colorado Photograph: geocaching.com 
Bassam is the place to play settler. This one-room log cabin in the rolling 
hills clustered at the feet of the Collegiate Peaks sits on a burbling creek in 
a massive stand of aspens. There is little to do but read in the hammock and 
contemplate the quiet. The fishing is good on public stretches of the nearby 
Arkansas river, and the cabin is equipped with a propane stove for frying up 
your catch. Otherwise, wander the surrounding game trails in search of deer, 
elk and wild turkey, and then huddle around the potbelly stove at night and 
read the history of James Frame, the ranger who looked after this place in the 
1920s.

Fowler-Hilliard Hut, Eagle
 Fowler Hilliard Hut, Eagle 
After it burned down four years ago, the 10th Mountain Division Hut 
Association reconstructed the Fowler-Hilliard hut (built in honour of two 
fallen Aspen mountaineers) in even greater glory in 2010. Perched on a hillside 
six miles west of Vail Pass, at 3,500m, the 16-person cabin is available on a 
per-person basis with shared accommodation, or as a full booking. Hundreds of 
miles of forest roads and trails stretch out in the surrounding high country, 
with hikes up nearby Ptarmigan Hill and Battle Mountain, and mountain bike 
access to the singletrack Colorado Trail.

Dunton Hot Springs, Dolores
 Dunton Hot Springs, Dolores 
This quaint resort, in the broad valley at the tail of the San Juan mountain 
range, is an old west ghost town lovingly renovated with full modern amenities. 
At 2,600m, the cabins – a mix of originals and others collected from around 
southern Colorado – huddle along a private stretch of the Dolores river, which 
offers some of the best fly fishing in the state. A web of hiking and mountain 
biking trails spider-web from the meadowed property, which has a renovated 
historic hot-spring bath house and a saloon and dancehall serving locally 
sourced meat and veggies, and wines from the renowned Sutcliffe Vineyards in 
neighbouring McElmo Canyon.

cabins from $550 a night. Open year round

4 UR Ranch, Creede
 4 UR Ranch, Creede 
Nestled away from the major thoroughfares and tourist towns of the south-west, 
4UR is a classic western retreat for anglers. There are daily trail rides 
through grassy pastures, hot springs for working out the kinks, and plenty of 
time for relaxing in the rockers on the porch. Many come to fish the six miles 
of private ponds and tailwater of Goose Creek, which are stuffed with strapping 
trout. Accommodation is in simple cabins, which lasso out from the central 
wood-beam lodge. It's all rustic chic, with bighorn sheep heads on the walls, 
saloon-style seating at the bar, and seared bison steak and fish fried by the 
ranch's Cordon Bleu-trained chef.

packages from $1,125pp full board on a double occupancy basis. Open

Vista Verde, Steamboat Springs
 Vista Verde, Steamboat 
If you're an equestrian looking to brush up on your herding skills, or you're 
interested in dude ranches, Vista Verde – tucked among the pines on the rolling 
hills north-east of Steamboat Springs, near the Wyoming border – is a ranch 
offering an endless network of high-altitude (2,050m) trail riding, cattle 
drives by day, and square dancing in the barn after dark. And for those 
disinclined to horses, guides will take you hiking, biking and kayaking in the 
surroundingRoutt national forest
