For an interesting evening and maybe someone who was OK to have a few drinks

Eighties pop and folk music, his vegetarianism, my love of roast chicken.

No.

All fine. We shared the starters.

A peck on the cheek.

He didn’t like his bourbon cocktail. (Negroni all the way!)

A solid 8.

Would you meet again?
I think so. I’m not sure about sparks and butterflies, but he’s a lovely guy.

Scott on Ryan

What were you hoping for?
No real expectations (though Chris Pratt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-pratt> did come to mind).

First impressions?
What a lovely smile.

What did you talk about?
Our professions, our countries of birth, his very intriguing upbringing, his 
dedication to his allotments – I’m actually considering one now.

Any awkward moments?
I think he looked disappointed initially, though that may have just been 
nerves.

Good table manners?
Completely, and attentive with filling wine glasses.

Best thing about Ryan?
That he was completely positive the whole evening.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Without hesitation.

Describe Ryan in three words
Handsome, engaging, enlightened.

What do you think he made of you?
The conversation never felt awkward, so I can only assume he enjoyed the 
evening.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, it was going on 11pm and we had work in the morning.

And… did you kiss?
A quick peck on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d probably go for a different restaurant due to the lack of veggie options.

Marks out of 10?
7.5.

Would you meet again?
He’s a lovely guy, but I think we’re heading down the friends route here.
