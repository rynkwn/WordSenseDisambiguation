The aperitivo is an old and civilised Italian custom, particularly in the 
north – a way of rounding off the working day by gathering in a bar for drinks 
and nibbles before heading home for dinner. Some bar owners offer more than 
just nuts and olives but, basically, the custom belongs to an old-style Italy, 
wheremamma’s food is best and the family gathers round her table each night.

But that is changing: mamma may be out at work herself, rather than in the 
kitchen hand-rolling tortelloni. In the past few years, starting in Milan and 
Turin, a new twist on the custom caters for students and a younger crowd – who 
perhaps don’t have the funds for a restaurant dinner, or the time to go home 
and eat before hitting the clubs. This is theapericena (formed by adding cena – 
dinner – to aperitivo).

Bars started offering a buffet of homemade hot and cold dishes with evening 
drinks – substantial enough to constitute a light dinner – at a relatively 
light price – often €10 for one drink and the buffet. High-end spots, with a 
great view or setting, say, rarely charge more than €20. Now, to the 
consternation of traditional restaurateurs, apericena joints have sprung up in 
many university cities – in Pisa, Florence, Bologna and Padua.

 Kitsch Bar, Florence. 
Crostini, bruschette, salads, roasted vegetables, cured meats, baked pastas, 
risottos and hot and cold meat and fish dishes, plus desserts from tarts to 
ice-creams, make satisfying and affordable fuel for a night on the tiles.

In Milan, apericena’s spiritual home, the Exotic restaurant and bar 
<http://www.exoticmilano.com/>, a short walk from the university, makes a 
feature of it on Monday nights, with a €10 buffet of salads, pastas, meats and 
vegetable dishes. At 10pm it is replaced by a dessert buffet: nutella-stuffed 
pastries, ice-cream and fruit.

In Turin, those in the know make for studenty, cinema-themed Lobelix Cafe 
<http://www.lobelixcafe.com/locali-torino-apericena.html> on Via Corte 
d’Appello. It’s decorated with old film posters and strips of film, and €11 
buys a drink (aperitif, glass of wine or draught beer) plus unlimited visits to 
the buffet of pasta, veg, meat and fish dishes – with glass covers to keep 
everything fresh and appetising. Food can be eaten on the closed-in terrace 
with views of the eponymous obelisk in Piazza Savoia.

 Lobelix Cafe, Turin 
Visitors to Italy’s tourist meccas can also enjoy the trend: studenty areas 
are the best bet. In Florence,Kitsch bar 
<http://www.kitschfirenze.com/kitschbar/> on Viale Gramsci is as ornate as the 
name suggests, and does a generous buffet of pastas and meat and veg dishes, 
plus fruit and cake (€10 for first drink, subsequent drinks €4). It’s mostly 
Tuscan food, but does occasional themed nights, such as Mexican. There is 
another branch, Kitsch Devx, near the station.

Apericena is harder to find in the south, but Bar Pappagallo 
<http://www.ilpappagallobar.com/en/> (via Anastasio II 45), behind the Vatican 
gardens in Rome, does an amazing value one for €8 every night until 10pm, with 
a cocktail, beer or wine, plus risottos, house-made pasta, veg, cold meats and 
cheese, and tasty nibbles like arancini.

And from this winter, you don’t even have to go to Italy for an apericena: 
northern wine bar chainVeeno <http://www.theveenocompany.com/> does an 
unlimited buffet of Italian food (£7 for first drink) every Wednesday in its 
Manchester, York and Leeds branches.
