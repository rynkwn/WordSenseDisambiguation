When we were little my mum used to make a date loaf. It was reliable rather 
than fun, but I still liked it, especially with butter and cheese. There were 
other cakes too, but the date loaf was “the cake” that was pretty much always 
in the kitchen. It was a bit like a teacake crossed with a malt loaf.

The date loaf was later toppled by the marmalade cake – a recipe from a 
neighbour called Frieda. The reason I remember this is because years later, in 
the throes of a romance with sticky-backed plastic and covering exercise books, 
I glued all my mum’s handwritten recipes on to squares of cereal packet 
cardboard, wrote the name of the person whose recipe it was at the top, then 
covered the whole thing in sticky-backed plastic. There was soft margarine and 
bitter orange marmalade in the marmalade cake batter, which meant it baked into 
a soft, sticky cake. As if it wasn’t sweet enough, it was finished with 
marmalade glaze, then swirled with icing. The best bits were the swirls, which 
could be picked off in big pieces, if you were lucky. My Dad is devoted to both 
marmalade and cake, so this cake always went down well with him. Then the 
marmalade cake was knocked off the cake podium by Rosie Mortimer’s chocolate 
brownies, tray after tray of which were made, cooled, iced and eaten. Those 
brownies were in our hands as we grew from kids charging round the kitchen and 
garden, into teens charging up the stairs.

Then Mum found her cake of cakes, Sophie Grigson 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Grigson>’s Caprese. I can picture the 
book the recipe comes from: it is bright yellow and called Organic: A New Way 
of Eating. These days I think we might refer to it as a flourless chocolate 
cake and talk about what it doesn’t have (gluten), as opposed to what it has – 
a habit I find very odd. Back then it was Sophie’s (no surname needed) Caprese 
or simply “the cake”. Just almonds, chocolate, butter, sugar and eggs, it is 
dense and dark cake. For about 12 years, and even now, every celebration, 
party, birthday, picnic, get-together, would be accompanied by the cake – 
possibly two – large, dark rounds, dusted with enough icing sugar to make sure 
some of it ended up on your jumper.

I never felt any need to make the cake myself. Until I moved to Rome that is, 
and alongside lots of learning and re-learning in the kitchen, there were waves 
of nostalgia cooking, attempts to conjure up what I was missing, and this 
included Sophie’s Caprese. Which is, of course, Italian – Caprese coming from 
the island of Capri; not that my nostalgia was bothered about that. I made 
plenty of scones and pies, too. Rome was also the place that reignited my love 
of writing and reading about food: I have chased almond and chocolate cakes 
through books by Artusi, Ada Boni, Elizabeth David, Delia and lots of others. 
For a while my cake was a bit Sophie, a bit Elizabeth, with advice from Capri.

Now that cake has been toppled by my take on Anna Del Conte’s daughter Julia’s 
cake, a name-tag that makes me wish I was still making recipe cards and 
covering them with sticky-backed plastic. It is such a good cake, and 
straightforward too, which is how cakes need to be for me – something you can 
make without too much fuss.

Whether you use whole or ground almonds depends on whether you are using a 
food processor or not. I do it all by hand so I buy good ground almonds (always 
check the date), and then chop the chocolate into relatively small but rough 
bits that then melt as the cake bakes, so the final cake looks like a speckled 
beauty. It is a dense, moist cake, with fat crumbs, not overly sweet and 
intensely chocolatey. Much has been written the merits of baking with almonds 
and no butter, so I won’t bore you. For the last two cakes I have added orange 
zest, so the cake reminds me of Terry’sChocolate 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chocolate> Orange, which I like, but 
it does compete with the almonds a little. I will leave the orange decision up 
to you.

You can take this cake anywhere and it will fit in. Dust with icing sugar if 
the occasion is celebratory, dark cocoa if it is fancy. My partner Vincenzo 
tells me it is an ideal breakfast cake, but he is Sicilian and can eat cassata 
first thing in the morning. I like it at about 11 o’clock with a cup of tea, 4 
o’clock with an espresso, or for pudding with cold cream.

Chocolate and almond cake

300g whole or ground almonds
200g dark chocolate
Zest of an unwaxed orange (optional)
200g caster sugar
A pinch of salt
5 tbsp whole milk
5 large eggs

1 Heat the oven to 180C/400F/gas mark 6. Generously butter and flour a 26cm 
cake tin, with a loose bottom if you like. If you want to roast the whole nuts, 
spread them on a baking sheet, and toast for 4–5 minutes, then rub with a cloth 
to get rid of the papery skin.

2 If you are using a food processor and whole almonds, pulse the nuts a few 
times, then add the roughly chopped chocolate and pulse until you have a coarse 
mixture.

3 If you are doing everything by hand, chop the chocolate finely with a sharp 
knife, grate over orange zest if you are using it, then mix with the ground 
almonds in a large bowl.

4 Add the sugar, salt and milk to the almond and chocolate and mix. Separate 
the eggs, setting the whites aside. Then beat the egg yolks into the mix one by 
one.

5 Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks and then fold into the 
mixture, then scrape the mixture into the prepared tin. Bake for 40-50 minutes 
or until the cake is firm and just turning golden, and a skewer or piece of 
spaghetti inserted comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tin for a while before 
turning out.W
