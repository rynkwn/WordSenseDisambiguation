Only the oldest of social care hands will recall the impact of the Seebohm 
Report <http://www.jstor.org/stable/30020595?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents> of 
1968: a strong unified local authority department; a commitment to professional 
development and a focus on prevention; partnership and harnessing the strengths 
of communities. It was all within a publicly funded and provided service – a 
public sector golden age that lasted little more than a decade.


Since 1979 there has been a remarkable shift in sectoral provision. In 1979, 
64% of residential and nursing home beds were provided by local authorities or 
the NHS; by 2012 it was 6%. In the case of domiciliary care, 95% was directly 
provided by local authorities as late as 1993; by 2012 it was just 11%. This 
has been accompanied by a growing role for large companies with 50+ homes at 
the expense of small, family run businesses – five large chains now account for 
20% of provision and this figure is expected to rise.

Does this matter? The obvious negative impact of the move to the private 
sector is on the workforce. Research hashighlighted an array of poor practices 
<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/adult-social-care-substantive/>
: restricted annual leave; a reduction in the numbers of qualified nursing 
staff; increased resident-staff ratios; sick pay removed; a failure to pay the 
national minimum wage; and an increase in zero-hour contracts. There is every 
reason to think that this, in turn, affects the quality of care staff deliver.

The big private operators say they have reached breaking point with the 
prospect of paying the living wage. Threats to leave the market are becoming 
routine. New research suggestsmore than a quarter of all care homes in the UK 
could go out of business <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b078w8rp> in the next 
three years as they struggle to cope with rising debt and antiquated 
infrastructure.

There’s no doubt that social care needs better funding. But we may want to ask 
why this should be funnelled into residential institutions – especially into 
business models based on private equity buyouts and offshore ownership. Some of 
these businesses are based on fragile and high risk investment models designed 
to maximise short-term financial returns, with perhaps less focus on the longer 
term or the wellbeing of service users.

An excellent new report from the Centre for Research in Socio-Cultural Change 
<http://www.mbs.ac.uk/news/research/people-management-organisations/where-does-the-money-go-when-your-local-authority-pays-more-than-5001-per-week-for-a-care-home-bed/>
 demonstrates that the calls from private companies for a “full cost” fee level 
are based on a wholly inappropriate return on investment of 12% – the report 
sensibly proposes a maximum return of 5%.

The privatisation process is so ingrained that a big bang reversal is 
unrealistic, but here are four tests that could improve the situation:

Transparency test: This could stipulate that where a public body has a legal 
contract with a private provider, it must ensure full openness and transparency 
with no “commercial confidentiality”. In addition, non-statutory providers 
could be made subject to local political scrutiny processes and to the Freedom 
of Information Act, from which they are currently excluded.

Ownership/taxation test: At a minimum (and in the light of the Panama Papers 
scandal) the ownership of all companies providing public services under 
contract to the public sector, including those with offshore or trust 
ownership, should be available on public record. A taxation test could require 
private companies in receipt of public services contracts to demonstrate they 
are domiciled in the UK and subject to UK taxation.

Workforce test: All providers should be expected to comply with minimum 
standards around workforce terms and conditions, training, development and 
supervision. This could include outlawing attempts to get round the national 
minimum wage levels such as not paying travel time between visits or using 
tracking devices that pay people by the minute. Commissioning bodies could also 
include procurement requirements designed to oblige all care providers to 
participate in collective bargaining, and to outlaw such practices as 
blacklisting workers for taking part in trade union activities.

Accountability test: At worst the big contractors are subject to short term 
bidding bans in the event of failure. Bringing democratic accountability is 
problematic. One option would be to explore some form of public “right of 
recall” where contracted-out services are thought to be of unacceptable quality 
– say where 3% of the adult electorate has formally petitioned the 
commissioning authority. More broadly, economist and writer Will Huttonargues 
for reform of the Companies Act 
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2d31b890-a63a-11e4-abe9-00144feab7de.html> to 
require businesses to deliver goods and services to meet social obligation, 
rather than short term enrichment.

Ultimately, however, we need to question large private chains founded on risky 
financial models having any place in the realm of personal care and support 
where the free market cannot profitably supply the services. Why aren’t we 
talking more about this?
