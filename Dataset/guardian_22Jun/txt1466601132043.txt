While the government will no longer force every state school in England to 
become an academy 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies>
 through legislation, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, remains committed 
to persuading schools to make the transition.

If schools do make the switch, academy status brings changes for the 
all-important governing body. So what are the main differences for people who 
are governors of an academy rather than a local authority (LA) school?

They have a different job title 

The language around academies is different from that of local authority 
schools. Local authority schools have governors who sit on a governing board, 
whereas academies have a two-tier system. At the top are members – usually two 
or three people who sit on the board of the trust and only have occasional 
meetings. They play an important role: they ensure that the academy trust’s 
charitable objectives are being met, maintain an overview of the effectiveness 
of the trust structure and have the power to appoint and remove trustees.

 Trustees are the people who fulfil the roles traditionally done by governors. 
Like all school governors, they promote the vision, ethos and strategic 
direction of the school; are a critical friend to the head and hold them to 
account for the school’s performance; and oversee the use of resources to 
ensure money is well spent.

Academy trustees are both company directors and charity trustees 

Academies have the legal status of companies and are also charitable trusts. 
This means trustees have the responsibilities of both company directors and 
charity trustees. They must have the best interests of the academy uppermost in 
their minds at all times, and have a duty of compliance, ensuring all relevant 
laws and regulations are followed. As holders of a public office, trustees 
should also be aware of theNolan principles of public life 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life>: 
selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and 
leadership.

Like all company directors and charity trustees, academy trustees must be 
autonomous in their decision-making and avoid conflicts of interest. For 
example, if they are connected to another organisation in the local community, 
such as a business, their decisions as a trustee must be made independently.

They have direct responsibility for admissions

Governors for voluntary controlled schools have to comply with the LA’s 
admissions arrangements, but academies have to devise and implement their own. 
This means deciding on the numbers admitted into the school and – just as 
importantly – the oversubscription criteria, which can be one of the most 
controversial elements of a school’s procedures. Whatever is decided on, 
arrangements must comply with the schools admissions code and be fair, clear 
and objective. There must also be an independent appeals panel to deal with 
parents who petition against a decision not to offer their child a place.

They have more specific financial responsibilities

Trustees are required to submit annual accounts and returns to the academy 
trust, Companies House and theEducation Funding Agency 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/education-funding-agency>. They 
are not allowed to set deficit budgets and must not have a deficit at the end 
of a financial year. Trusts are not allowed to borrow money either. If a trust 
is deemed to have failed to run the academy’s finances properly, it is likely 
to receive afinancial notice to improve 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/academies-financial-notices-to-improve>
 from the funding agency. The audited accounts must also be published on the 
trust’s website.

They are not accountable to the local authority

In academies, regional schools commissioners (RSCs) and headteacher boards 
replace local authorities in terms of oversight and accountability. RSCs are 
responsible for intervening in academies where governance is inadequate, and 
have wide-ranging responsibilities to get involved when academies are 
underperforming. There are eight RSCs across eight regions in England; rather 
than intervening directly, RSCs commission teaching schools and other beacons 
of excellence in education to improve underperforming schools.

They have different liabilities

Trustees often worry about personal liability and whether, if something goes 
wrong, as company directors and charity trustees they could be held 
individually responsible. In practice, however, unless they have been grossly 
negligent, trustees should not worry too much as the government has put in 
place recommendations regarding academy trustee liabilities in the case of 
financial difficulties. It’s the board as an entity that is responsible. Even 
where decisions are taken by an individual governor or a committee of the 
governing board, provided the decision is taken with what theCharity Commission 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/476870/CC27.pdf>
 (pdf) defines as “genuine, honest intentions or motives, trying to do the 
right thing, in the interests of the charity” no liability will attach to an 
individual. However, insurance is available and some trusts have it.

As an employer, an academy trust is responsible for the health and safety of 
pupils and staff. They are required to ensure that systems are in place to 
ensure regular health and safety audits are carried out.
