I’ve just come back from the seaside, where I made the most of the local 
catch. I tossed crab, which is always a treat, in a salad of buckwheat, an 
ingredient with which I’ve recently become fascinated. The crab’s sweetness 
stood out against the earthy grain, and was mellowed by bittersweet grapefruit. 
(If you find buckwheat too strong, soften it by mixing it 50:50 with wild rice.)

Brown shrimps are another seaside luxury, and these I potted in a mace-laced 
butter. Nothing beats butter melting on bread fresh from the oven, and a fast 
and easy soda bread was the perfect match for the shrimps; mine uses Kamut 
flour, an ancient wheat variety readily available in supermarkets and easier to 
digest than conventional flour.

Crab, grapefruit and buckwheat salad

Nutty buckwheat is a great partner for delicate crab and dill, all lightened 
with a sharp, sweet dressing. This salad is great with crispbreads and a garlic 
mayo (use wild garlic, if you can). Serves four.

150g buckwheat
½ large cucumber, chopped
1 small bunch dill, roughly chopped
2 spring onions, finely sliced
1 pink grapefruit, segmented
200g white crab meat
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the dressing
1 tbsp cider vinegar
½ tsp sugar
Juice of 1 lime
4 tbsp rapeseed oil

For the allioli (optional)
1 handful wild garlic leaves (or 3 cloves garlic, peeled)
2 free-range egg yolks
250ml mild olive oil
Lemon juice

In a small pan on a medium heat, toast the buckwheat for five minutes. Bring a 
litre of salted water to a boil, add the buckwheat and simmer for 10 minutes 
(or as instructed on the packet), until the grains are almost tender and have 
absorbed most of the water. Drain and leave to cool a little.

To make the allioli, if using, finely chop the wild garlic leaves (or whole 
cloves), put in a food processor with the egg yolks and a generous pinch of 
salt, and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip 
three-quarters of the oil through the funnel until the mix starts to thicken 
and emulsify, then pour in the rest of the oil in a slow, steady stream. Season 
to taste with lemon juice and salt, loosen to a thick mayo consistency with a 
few tablespoons of water and transfer to a bowl.

Whisk the dressing ingredients in the base of a serving dish, season to taste, 
then add all the ingredients for the salad and toss. Serve with crusty bread or 
baked pitta crisps, and the garlicky mayonnaise.

Kamut is a trademarked khorasan wheat flour of the sort I mentioned here the 
other week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/roast-chicken-puttanesca-recipe-spiced-pineapple-coconut-thomasina-miers>
. It needs more liquid than other flours, so add just enough to make a wet, 
sticky dough. The buttery shrimps are gorgeous on the warm nutty bread. Serves 
four.

500g Kamut (or other khorasan) flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp fine sea salt
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
200ml natural whole milk yoghurt
300ml whole milk
150ml buttermilk
Olive oil, for greasing
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds

For the shrimps
200g butter
1 blade mace
1 bay leaf
¼ tsp paprika
Juice from ½ lemon
200g peeled brown shrimps
Lemon wedges, to serve

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Mix the dry ingredients for the bread, 
then quickly stir in the yoghurt, milk and buttermilk, either by hand or with a 
dough hook on a food processor. Don’t overwork, or the loaf will be on the 
heavy side. Form into a wet ball, then put on an oiled baking sheet. Score a 
deep cross in the top of the loaf, sprinkle with flour and pumpkin seeds, then 
bake on the middle shelf for 50 minutes to an hour, until the base sounds 
hollow when you tap it. Leave to cool (remember, it will keep cooking once out 
of the oven).

For the shrimps, melt the butter in a pan, then add all the other ingredients 
apart from the shrimps and lemon wedges. Simmer for a couple of minutes, taking 
care that the butter doesn’t burn, then take off the heat. When the butter has 
cooled a little, but not completely, add the shrimps, season and stir. Put the 
pan in the fridge and stir every three minutes for 15 minutes, until the butter 
begins to firm up. Before it hardens completely, transfer the buttery prawns to 
four 150ml ramekins, then leave to set for 20 minutes out of the fridge. If not 
serving them immediately, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate; take out about 
20 minutes before serving, to soften.

Serve with thick slices of the warm soda bread and lemon wedges.

And for the rest of the week…

Make double the bread mix, and use the excess for cheddar soda bread scones. 
Add 200g coarsely grated mature cheddar to the spare dough, as well as three 
finely chopped spring onions and a pinch of cayenne, and shape into scones. 
Bake for 25-30 minutes and serve with a tomato chilli jam and cream cheese or 
goat’s cheese. Add an extra cucumber to the spare half-cucumber from the crab 
salad, and make a pickle. Finely slice the cukes and two banana shallots and 
put in a bowl or jar. Gently heat equal quantities of cider vinegar and water, 
pour over the cucumber mix, then season to taste (add some chilli, if you 
like). Dilute and chill the pickling liquor with a few cubes of ice, cover and 
refrigerate for at least a few hours. (This pickle would work very well with 
the shrimps, by the way.) Toss any leftover crab in the garlic mayo, stuff 
inside an avocado half, season with lime and a touch of smoked paprika, and eat 
with a crisp, baby gem salad.
