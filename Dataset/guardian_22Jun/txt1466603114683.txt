The African Union (AU) is now 50 years old. Amid the celebrations this week 
<http://www.modernghana.com/news/464864/1/african-union-commemorates-50th-anniversary.html>
, the AU – which was established as the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)in 
1963 <http://www.au.int/en/sites/default/files/OAU_Charter_1963.pdf> (pdf) – 
needs to take stock of its strengths and weaknesses as an intergovernmental 
organisation designed to promote the pan-African agenda politically and 
economically. As articulated by the leading figures of pan-Africanism, that 
agenda consists of a three-dimensional project of political self-determination, 
economic self-reliance, and solidarity in the promotion and defence of African 
interests nationally and internationally.

The OAU came into existence as a compromise between the radical pan-Africanism 
of leaders such asKwame Nkrumah <http://www.nkrumah.net/>, who advocated a 
union government and a continental military high command, and the more 
conservative outlook of the pro-western leaders of Nigeria, Ivory Coast and 
Liberia, who insisted on a gradual approach to African economic and political 
integration.

Despite the antagonistic positions separating them, the groups were both 
favourable to setting up a pan-African institution based on the principles of 
state sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of member states 
and the inviolability of national boundaries.

Within the global context of the cold war, the more limited goals of the OAU 
were (1) the total independence ofAfrica 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa> from colonialism and white settler 
rule; (2) the peaceful resolution of interstate conflicts through negotiation, 
mediation and conciliation; and (3) greater solidarity and economic 
co-operation.

Decolonisation and majority rule, particularly in the colonial-settler states 
of Algeria, Kenya and South Africa where racism was institutionalised, were a 
major achievement of the project. The culminating event was the liberation of 
South Africa from apartheid in 1994, ending 82 years of struggle led by the 
African National Congress and 31 years of support by the continent through the 
OAU.

This unswerving opposition to white minority rule and colonialism is 
undoubtedly the OAU's greatest achievement. It succeeded in mobilising African 
and world opinion against colonialists in the Portuguese colonies and settler 
states of Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The worldwide isolation of the 
apartheid state of South Africa, including its exclusion from international 
organisations and sporting events, was spearheaded by the OAU. And the OAU 
African Liberation Committee deserves praise for its outstanding work in 
supporting armed struggle in Guinea-Bissau and southern Africa. Guinea, 
Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe also made great sacrifices in 
supporting total liberation from colonial oppression.

The OAU also had some achievements in conflict resolution 
<http://www.international-alert.org/news/promoting-peace>, particularly 
mediating in border disputes, the major area of interstate conflict in Africa. 
However, most of the armed conflicts since independence have been internal 
rather than interstate. As a pan-African organisation, the OAU had an 
obligation to address such conflicts, inasmuch as they involved gross 
violations of human rights, including cases of genocide, and had a humanitarian 
dimension in the large number of refugees and internally displaced people they 
generated.

Unfortunately, the OAU failed to exercise its right of intervention in cases 
of state-sponsored terrorism and heinous crimes, including ethnic cleansing and 
genocide. The organisation expressed little or no solidarity with Africans 
facing mortal danger from their own governments and never recognised the 
legitimacy of African struggles against African tyrants. In 1979, when President
Julius Nyerere of Tanzania <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/441768.stm> 
took the courageous decision to pursue invading Ugandan troops all the way to 
Kampala and assist Ugandan patriots in overthrowing the regime of Idi Amin 
Dada, he found very little support among his African peers.

Things changed for the better in the 1990s, particularly with the adoption in 
1993 in Cairo of the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and 
resolution, which gave the organisation a role in internal conflicts.Since 
replacing the OAU in 2002 <http://www.au.int/en/about/nutshell>, the AU has 
increased its intervention in domestic affairs. Both the AU commission and the 
regional economic communities (RECs) have played a useful role, sending 
peacekeeping forces to countries in turmoil. The RECs seem to be playing a 
greater role in resolving internal conflicts than in promoting economic 
co-operation and integration.

A major problem confronting the AU is resources. With so much dependence on 
the EU and other external funding, questions arise about African ownership and 
initiative in some of the theatres of intervention. In addition to governments' 
lack of political will, the lack of resources for peace and security, as well 
as economic co-operation, is partly because countries are also members of 
multiple regional institutions. It is not uncommon for a country to belong to 
three or more regional economic groups. By spreading themselves thin, countries 
deprive institutions of the skills and money they need. This raises the 
question of how strongly committed Africa's leaders are to economic and 
political integration.

This is at the heart of the AU's future. Its neoliberal development programme, 
Nepad <http://www.nepad.org/>, is less suited to the needs of workers and 
peasants than the more comprehensive development strategy of theLagos plan of 
action <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Plan_of_Action>, adopted in 1980. As 
an organisation that reflects the social character of the states composing it,
most of which are under authoritarian rulers 
<http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportId=18761> who cling to power 
through force and electoral fraud, the AU is ill-equipped to meet people's 
aspirations for democracy and social progress.
