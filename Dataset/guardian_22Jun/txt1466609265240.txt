Dyer's Burgers – Double Double
 Dyer's burgers 
The secret is in the grease. Dyer's Burgers has been frying paper-thin burgers 
in the same seasoned grease recipe for 101 years – the grease is changed 
regularly, however. The patties are carefully scraped off a marble countertop, 
laid into an over-sized skillet of grease and pulled out just as they begin to 
float. Burgers are served as singles, doubles and triples, all with or without 
cheese, and garnished traditionally with a simple combination of mustard, 
pickles and onion. It's melted perfection on a burger bun. As Beale Street 
winds down late at night, that's when a Dyer's Double Double is truly at its 
best. As the servers' T-shirts say: "Have you had your Vitamin G?" The G is for 
grease.
• 205 Beale Street, +1 901 527 3937, dyersonbeale.com

The Arcade Restaurant – The Elvis
 Photograph: Alamy 
The oldest restaurant still operating in Memphis just happens to be a Greek 
diner that serves a dish built for a King. Yes, Elvis Presley himself was a 
regular patron at The Arcade Restaurant in the South Main Historic District. 
Right in that very location, he transformed the Fried Peanut Butter and Banana 
sandwich into a Memphis classic. It's made with two slices of thick Texas toast 
generously buttered, grilled and loaded up with chunky peanut butter and ripe 
banana slices. But wait, add a couple strips of smoked bacon and now you have a 
hearty meal that could easily be mistaken for a dessert.

Kooky Canuck – Holy Smoke Burger
 Kooky Canuck 
Only a "Kooky Canuck" would place a half-pound seasoned burger patty into a 
pool of spicy "Holy Smoke" hotwings sauce, top it with smoked cheddar cheese

of hand-cut fries. Be warned though, the Holy Smoke Burger is not for the
