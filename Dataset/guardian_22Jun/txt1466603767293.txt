Andrew Wong’s Michie’s sweet and sour ribs

I learned the recipe for these ribs while I was in Sichuan and since then it 
has even found its way to the island of the Seychelles where my sister-in-law 
Michie makes a special request for them whenever my family and I fly over. I am 
hoping that, armed with this recipe, she can now make them herself!

Serves 4
vegetable oil for deep-frying
toasted sesame seeds 2 tbsp
sesame oil 2 tbsp

For the ribs
pork ribs 500g, separated into individual ribs
spring onion 10g, roughly chopped
fresh root ginger 5g, peeled and sliced
fermented black beans 5g
Shaoxing rice wine 1 tbsp
light soy sauce 1 tbsp
dark soy sauce 2 tsp
salt 3g

For the sticky sauce
sugar 500g
water 800ml
Chinese red vinegar 150ml
malt vinegar 150ml
star anise 5g

For the ribs, mix all the ingredients together and steam over a low heat for 2 
hours or until the ribs are tender but just holding on to the bone. Remove the 
ribs from the steamer and leave to cool and dry.


Heat the oil for deep-frying in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Deep-fry the ribs, 
in batches, until they darken slightly in colour. Remove from the oil and drain 
on kitchen paper.

If you don’t have a deep-fat fryer, fill a deep pan with oil – the oil should 
come far enough up the sides of the pan to cover the ribs. However, you can 
also shallow fry them with a few tablespoons of oil just to crisp up the 
surface of the ribs.

For the sticky sauce, bring all the ingredients to the boil in a large pan, 
stirring, and cook until the mixture reduces to a honey-like consistency.

Add the deep-fried ribs and cook until the sauce sticks to the ribs. Add the 
sesame seeds and sesame oil to finish.

When it comes to learning about Chinese pastries, wontons are the best 
starting point. The pastry comes ready-made in most Oriental supermarkets, and 
is very much like an egg pasta. The method of folding below creates a shape 
much like a gold ingot (pre-20th century Chinese currency) and it is said that 
if you can fold your wontons in such a shape, you are giving your friends and 
family plenty of good wealth for years to come!


Serves 4
garlic 1 clove
spring onion 1
coriander a large handful, plus extra to garnish
Chinese chives 10-15
dried shiitake mushrooms 3, drained and soaked
Chinese leaf cabbage 2 leaves
raw tiger prawns 150g, peeled and deveined (optional)
light soy sauce 1 tbsp
granulated sugar ½ tsp
sesame oil 2 tsp
wonton pastries 20

For the chilli broth
chicken stock 200ml
oyster sauce ½ tbsp
Chiu Chow chilli oil 2 tsp

Finely chop the garlic, spring onion, coriander, Chinese chives, soaked 
shiitake mushrooms and Chinese leaves and place in a mixing bowl. Finely dice 
the prawns (if using) and add to the mixing bowl along with the soy sauce, 
sugar and sesame oil. Mix everything together

Wrap the wontons. Place 1 teaspoon of filling in the centre of each pastry. 
Using the tip of your finger, wet all sides of the pastry with cold water.

Fold the bottom corner over the filling to the top corner and press the pastry 
down to seal all sides (to form a triangle). Holding the base of the filling 
with your thumbs, pull the 2 corners of the triangle towards each other. (In my 
cookery school, we like to call this the “Dark Knight Rising” as it looks 
roughly like a Batman shape.)

Overlap the ends and press together to form a “gold ingot/trough” shape. Set 
aside and fold the rest of the wontons.

To cook, place all the wontons in a large, deep bowl. Bring the chicken stock 
to a simmer in a saucepan, then stir in the oyster sauce and chilli oil. Pour 
the broth ingredients over the wontons.

Set the wok up with a steamer stand and fill with boiling water to a third of 
the way up the sides. Put the wonton bowl into the wok, cover with a lid and 
steam for 6-8 minutes, until the wontons have shrivelled slightly and are 
cooked through. Remove from the wok and serve garnished with a little chopped 
coriander.

TIP
Dumplings can be kept in the freezer once made. They must be cooked from 
frozen for 2 minutes longer than the recommended cooking time when cooking 
fresh, rather than allowing them to thaw out and lose their shape.

Kung pao dishes are a celebration of texture, a cascade of crunchy, slippery 
and crisp that keeps every bite interesting. We’ve made two tweaks to the 
classic: we dialed the heat down, and swapped the more common chicken for 
prawns. The prawn substitution we stand by; the chilli heat is your call and 
very easy to ramp up.

Makes 2-4 servings
For the sauce
water 2 tbsp
soy sauce 1 tbsp
Shaoxing rice wine 1 tbsp
Chinkiang vinegar 1 tbsp
sugar 1 tbsp
sesame oil 1 tsp
cornflour 1 tsp
white pepper a pinch

For the stir fry
neutral oil 3 tbsp
dried red chillies 10 small
Sichuan peppercorns 1 tsp
minced garlic 2 tsp
fresh ginger 2 tsp minced
red pepper ½, cut into 1cm pieces
green pepper ½, cut into 1cm pieces
celery 2 stalks, cut into 1cm pieces
large prawns 450g, shelled and deveined
sea salt

spring onions 2, cut into 2.5cm pieces
unsalted peanuts 75g, roasted
cooked rice for serving

Make the sauce: whisk together the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until the 
cornflour is dissolved. Set aside.


Make the stir fry: heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok over a high heat. 
Add the chillies and peppercorns and stir fry until they puff and brown 
slightly, about 5 seconds. Add the garlic, ginger and peppers and stir fry 
until the peppers are browned in spots and crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Using 
a slotted spoon, transfer the mixture to a plate. Add the celery to the pan and 
stir fry until heated through and charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer 
to the plate with the peppers.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the wok. Season the prawns with salt and 
add to the wok. Stir fry until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Return 
the peppers, celery and spices to the wok.

Add the spring onions and peanuts and toss to combine everything. Add the 
sauce and cook, stirring, until it bubbles and thickens. When the sauce is 
thick and the prawns are cooked through, remove from the heat. Serve with rice.

Makes 15-16 buns
For the bao buns
white bread flour 500g
caster sugar 50g
salt 3g
baking powder 4g
quick yeast 5g
lukewarm water 145ml
milk 145ml
vegetable oil 15ml, plus extra for greasing

For the char sui pork belly
pork belly 500g
salt 1 tsp
five spice powder 1 tsp
premium soy sauce 2 tsp
Shaoxing rice wine 1 tbsp
hoisin sauce 2 tbsp
honey 2 tbsp
sugar 2 tbsp
water 500ml

For the pickled daikon
daikon (mooli) 1 small, peeled and sliced thinly – 2mm thickness
rice vinegar 125ml
water 125ml
caster sugar 1 tbsp
salt ¼ tsp
turmeric powder 1 tsp

For the pickled daikon, mix all of the ingredients together and leave to 
pickle for at least a day.


Put the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and yeast together in a bowl, and 
add the water and milk to the mix. Combine everything with your hands until it 
forms a mass. Add the 15ml oil and start kneading the dough for a good 15 
minutes until it no longer sticks.

Place the smooth dough into a bowl and cover with clingfilm. Let it prove for 
an hour or until it doubles in size.

Once the dough is proved, roll it into a long batten shape and divide the 
dough with a scraper or knife to 15-16 equal portions. Roll them tightly to 
form ball shapes.

Press the ball and flatten it into oval shapes with a rolling pin. Grease the 
dough with oil. Pick up the dough and use chopsticks to help fold the dough in 
halves. Let it rest for a good 15 minutes on baking paper until it’s puffed up 
again. Make sure there’s enough room in between each dough for them to grow.

Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to boil. When the dough is proved, pick them 
up with the baking sheet still under, place on a steamer over the pan. Let it 
steam on a high heat for 20 minutes until nice and fluffy. Once steamed, the 
buns are ready to serve. Or allow them to cool and refrigerate to use at 
another time.

To make the pork, preheat the oven to 100C/gas mark ¼. Pour all the 
ingredients into a baking dish with the pork belly. Make sure all the belly is 
covered and cook for 3 hours until very tender to touch. Remove the pork from 
the sauce. Place the sauce on the hob and reduce until sticky. Slice the pork 
belly into 1cm slices.

To assemble, steam the bun. Brush the pork belly with the char sui sauce. 
Place the pork and a little pickled daikon into the bao and serve.

When you see beef in oyster sauce on a menu, it usually means beef slices in 
an oyster sauce gravy, which may be fine for some occasions, but this 
tongue-numbingly peppery yet sweet recipe really is the David Beckham of beef 
in oyster sauce. Using a wok really isn’t a craftless exercise of tossing a 
metal pan backwards and forwards – there is a fine art to controlling the 
temperature and knowing the right time to agitate the food in the pan, and this 
is the dish that first made me appreciate the intricacies involved. It is the 
dish that really puts my chefs to the test, as the ingredients have to be added 
in the right order, with each one being cooked at the correct temperature, just 
enough to release the fragrance but not enough to burn. If they cook this well, 
I know they can be trusted!

Serves 2
vegetable oil for deep-frying, plus a drizzle
beef rump 200g, thinly sliced
salt a pinch
Shaoxing rice wine 2 tsp
light soy sauce 1 tsp
onion 15g, cut into small chunks
fresh root ginger 5g, peeled, thinly sliced
dried red chilli 2g
fresh large red chillies 100g, cut into 1cm sections
Chinese chives a small handful
Sichuan peppercorns 3g, ground, toasted
sugar 2g
oyster sauce 2 tsp
preserved plum a grating (see below)
sea beet leaves to garnish (optional)

Heat the oil for deep-frying in a deep-fat fryer to 150C.


Season the beef with the salt, wine and soy sauce, then deep-fry, in batches, 
until it just changes colour. Remove the beef from the oil and drain on kitchen 
paper.

Heat a drizzle of oil in a hot wok, add the onion, ginger and dried chillies 
and stir fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add the beef, fresh chillies, Chinese chives, Sichuan pepper, sugar and oyster 
sauce and stir fry for 30 seconds.

Finish the dish with a grating of preserved plum before serving immediately, 
garnished with sea beet leaves, if you like.

TIP
What are preserved plums? They are dried plums that are dusted with sugar, 
salt, liquorice powder and citric acid. Usually used either as a snack or to 
infuse drinks with their unique sweet-and-sour fruitiness, they are available 
from good Chinese supermarkets.
